# Tsinsen_ACM
The project is about ACM training exercises from Tsinsen website, which is support by Tsinghua University.
All solutions for exercise are 100 score, total score is 100. The name of the directory is the name 
of the exercise from that website corresponding exercise. Please check http://www.tsinsen.com/ for
all problems. If you want to see the problems, you must be registered. But if you don't want, does't 
matter, I will provide the exercises in every directory by png picture. I wish you can improve these
codes with me so make it faster even though it is 100 score, thank you.

If you want a English version about these problems because you don't know Chinese, please send me 
email. 

I will express my gratitude for Miss Liu, a beautiful and loving studying girl, always
keeping curiosity, she help me to push and test many problems, thank you, a sweet girl.
